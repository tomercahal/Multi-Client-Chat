# Multi-Client-Chat
In this project I created a multi-client chat.\
I have a server side and a client side. You have many options to choose from as a client such as: send a message to everyone, send a private message. Become a manager, managers can kick and mute other users. 

## To Run: ##
In this project I used python 2.7. If you want to run this project on your computer you will need to download two files.\
The first is: `Chat_server.py` which is the server file and in order to run it you will need to enter `python Chat_server.py`\
The second is: `Chat_client.py` which is thge client file and in order to run it you will need to enter `python Chat_client.py`


I hope you enjoy this project, and if you have and suggestions please let me know!

Link to a video of me showing the project will be avaiable in the upcoming days.:grin:
